\begin{abstract}
In small broadband access networks (e.g., home networks), the bandwidth is usually limited. In the meanwhile,\
different applications have different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and they all compete for the scarce bandwidth.\
Unfortunately, many users are not savvy enough to configure QoS parameters of the underlying network to meet their needs.
