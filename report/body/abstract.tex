\begin{abstract}
In small broadband access networks (e.g., home networks), the bandwidths are usually limited.\
In the meanwhile, different applications have different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements\
and they all compete for the scarce bandwidth. Unfortunately, many users are not savvy enough\
to configure QoS parameters of the underlying network to meet their needs. In this paper, we\
present \emph{QoSManager}, a configurable and adaptive QoS management framework where users\
can specify QoS requirements for different applications at a high level. It monitors network\
and dynamically installs traffic shaping rules for application flows. In QoSManager, we propose\
a novel algorithm that takes QoS requirements and flows information as input and outputs an\
assignment of flows to queues of different rate to satisfy as many QoS requirements as possible.\
We implement QoSManager on Ryu and Open vSwitch (OVS) and demonstrate that it can provide QoS\
guarantee according to users' specifications in the presence of active competing traffic.
