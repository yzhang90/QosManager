In a broadband access network (e.g., home network), the bandwidth is limited. In the meanwhile,
different applications have different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and they all
compete for the scarce bandwidth. Unfortunately, many users are not savvy enough to configure
QoS parameters of the underlying network to meet their needs. In this paper, we present
\emph{QoSManager}, a configurable and adaptive QoS management framework. QoSManager provides an
interface for users to specify QoS policies for different applications at runtime (configurable).
It monitors the network and dynamically installs traffic shaping rules for application flows (adaptive). 
In QoSManager, we propose a novel algorithm that computes an assignment of flows to queues with
appropriate rates to maximize the QoS requirements satisfied under the limited bandwidth. We implement
QoSManager on top of Ryu and Open vSwitch (OVS) and demonstrate that it can effectively provide QoS
guarantee according to users' specifications in the presence of active competing traffic.
