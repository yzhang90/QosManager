\subsection{Traditional QoS strategies}
There are two types of strategies in traditional QoS: integrated services and differentiated services.
Integrated services are fine-grained and per-flow. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Every network element has to reserve resources for each flow.
\item Router has limited computational resources; hard to classify all app flows.
\item Not scalable.
\end{itemize}

Differentiated services~\cite{DiffServ} are more coarse-grained.
\begin{itemize}
\item Rely on the 8-bit DS field in the IP header. DiffServ routers then decide on per-hop basis how to forward packets based on their class.
\item It is static (because of the predefined number of classes) and lacks the ability to fine-tune the QoS of separate flows.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{SDN enabled QoS approach}
\subsubsection{Resource Reservation}
FlowQoS~\cite{Seddiki_HotSDN14} and EuQoS~\cite{Sharma_EWSDN14}
\subsubsection{Per-flow Routing Frameworks}
For Open-QoS~\cite{Egilmez_ASPIPA12}, after classification, high priority flows are placed on QoS guaranteed routes.

\subsubsection{Queue Management and Packet Scheduling}
\subsubsection{Policy Enforcement}

\subsection{QoS in home netowrks}
Several other approaches explore QoS in home networks.
Yiakoumis et al. proposed letting users notify the ISP about
their bandwidth needs for a given application; in this case, provisioning
occurs in the ISP’s last mile, not in the home.
Georgopoulos et al. proposed an OpenFlow-assisted framework
that improves users’ quality of experience (QoE) in
home networks for multimedia flows, subject to fairness constraints. The system allocates resources to each device
but does not perform per-application or per-flow QoS. Mortier
et al. developed Homework, a home networking platform that
provides per-flow measurement and management capabilities
for home networks. Homework allows users to monitor
and control per-device and per-protocol usage, but it does not
provide QoS support or perform any application classification.
